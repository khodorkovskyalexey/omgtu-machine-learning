## Data Set Information:

This dataset was used to develop quantitative regression QSAR models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow) on a set of 908 chemicals. LC50 data, which is the concentration that causes death in 50% of test fish over a test duration of 96 hours, was used as model response. The model comprised 6 molecular descriptors: MLOGP (molecular properties), CIC0 (information indices), GATS1i (2D autocorrelations), NdssC (atom-type counts), NdsCH ((atom-type counts), SM1_Dz(Z) (2D matrix-based descriptors). Details can be found in the quoted reference: M. Cassotti, D. Ballabio, R. Todeschini, V. Consonni. A similarity-based QSAR model for predicting acute toxicity towards the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), SAR and QSAR in Environmental Research (2015), 26, 217-243; doi: 10.1080/1062936X.2015.1018938
